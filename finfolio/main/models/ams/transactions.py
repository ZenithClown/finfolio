"""
Transactions Table for Account Management System [AMS]

The main/core transactions table that holds all the transactions
information along with certain additional derived features (explained
on each line) is defined.

The transactions are maintained at "account type" level, this makes
it easier to segregate and understand primary, secondary and other
sources of income/expenditure. In addition, it is not practical to
group all transactions in a table as "DEBIT" account transactions are
very different from "DEMAT" account transactions, etc.
