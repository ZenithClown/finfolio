/********************************************************************
A Code to Fetch Account Details for a Logged In User for Analysis

A logged in user can view all the accounts that is either directly
managed by them or can view all the accounts that are managed by user
under the ROOT/SUDO list while a USER can view only their account.

Documentation for the function with changelog (if any) is documented
as below:

Get Ledger Account JSON : /rpc/get_ledger_account_json
======================================================

Get the list of ledger accounts for an already logged in user based
on the function that returns the value in a JSON format like below:

```json
[
  {'ledger_account_id' : 'account_name'},
  {'ledger_account_id' : 'account_name'},
  ...
]
```

The function is designed to fetch all the debit accounts (by default)
that are directly mapped under a user or is under a user who is
managed by the logged in user, with an optional parameter to fetch the
type of account. To fetch all the account pass `NULL` as the second
argument, or pass the like clause key for global search.

The function is dynamic and accepts raw JSON as parameter during the
POST call with any method:

```sql
SELECT * FROM api.get_ledger_account_json('username'); -- default
SELECT * FROM api.get_ledger_account_json('username', NULL); -- all
```
