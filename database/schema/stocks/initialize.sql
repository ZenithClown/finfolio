special schema. Check the database/initialize.sql for more details on
setting the configurations.

Optional schemas can be initialized and tables added into the database
if the extension is required by the end user. This must be provided
in a dropdown to take necessary actions during setup.

The stocks schema represents stocks market data (mutual funds, shares,
etc.) which can be tracked and analyzed.
