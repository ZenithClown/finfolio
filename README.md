[**pOrgz**](https://github.com/pOrgz-dev) is a cross-platform, AI/ML-enabled open-source, modern, secure financial application to analyze, monitor, and track expenses at an individual, group, or organization level.
The application is built for people with extremely high secure personal data management demands and can be used in Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
It saves different types of information like account details, account owner, and financial transactions which can be managed/edited/updated by an administrator or a privileged user.

## Quick Start Guide

The application is currently in development phase, and people with a background of coding knowledge are preferred to test the application. The quick start guide is yet in the development phase and will be released with the first project release.

## Contribution

We are always looking for suggestions to improve the services, and to include new features into the application. The application is primarily developed in [`python`](https://www.python.org/) and [`SQLite`](https://sqlite.org/index.html) is considered the default database.
