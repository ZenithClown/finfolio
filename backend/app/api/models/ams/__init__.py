"""
The Account Management System (AMS) Branch of FINFOLIO Project

The AMS is dedicated towards account management, like creating a new
account, updating user details related to an account, and also stores
the transactions of all the related tracked account.

The AMS is controlled using some static data (`metadata`) to efficiently
handle account transactions, and these values are pre-seeded from the
`backend.app.config.seed.*.py` files. As a standard practice, the
metadata tables are in all caps leading with `META_` keyword.
