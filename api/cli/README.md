<div align = "justify">

pOrgz is a personal financial management tool that helps you keep track of all your transactions accros multiple different types of accounts with ease. The application works completely on a local machine and there is no need for internet connectivity, in addition the application does not track anything (be it email, messages) to provide information. As an end user, you are supposed to update the database at a regular interval - and let `pOrgz` provide you with insights.

Until a full fldged front end is developed, functionalities of the application is available as a command line interface. For developers, please use applications like `postman` to handle API requests.
