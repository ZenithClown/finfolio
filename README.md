**Project `finfolio`** is a personal finance management and analysis system that helps individuals track income, expenses, savings, and
investments with **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and interactive **Power BI dashboards**.

## ðŸ“œ Project Objective

Most personal finance tools in the market depend on **third-party integrations** such as email parsing, SMS reading, or
automatic syncing with bank accounts. While convenient, these approaches often come at the cost of **privacy** â€” data is shared
across multiple platforms, leaving users with little control over how their financial information is stored or used.

This application takes a **privacy-first approach** to personal finance management, ensuring that users maintain complete
ownership of their data.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Objectives

The project has the following key objectives and development stages, complexity (user-friendly), and other important details
are as follows:
