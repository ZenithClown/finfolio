/********************************************************************
DBML - Database Markup Language for ERD & Documentation

DBML is an unique language developed by the Holistics Software INC.
(https://www.holistics.io/) designed to define and document database
structures and schema (https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/home).

## Schema Overview

The schema is designed for personal financial analysis (for self and
other family members) that gives a quick glimpse on the earnings and
expenditure. The design is kept as simple as possible, however it is
recommended that people with a coding background to use the same.

More Information: https://github.com/ZenithClown/finfolio

## Adopted Schema Namespace & Definition

A single file approach is adopted for easier management,
documentation and understanding the schema layout. While any type of
database can be used to store the data, PostgreSQL is used as the
de-facto database by myself.

### METADATA Schema Namespace

A special schema namespace to hold configuration and related
information that is being used in the database for various reporting.

## Data Security & BI

The data security is left at the discretion of the end-user. Note
that the tool is developed for personal finance management and a
person with the knowledge of database and related tools used are
required to handle the same.

Typically, if an user uses secured client-server database like MySQL
or PostgreSQL then the same may suffice in terms of security.
