/********************************************************************
A Set of TAG(s) Defined to Categorize Transactions

The tags are maintained at different level, like account, method, end
user tags, etc. which can be used for categorizing the transactions
and thus in better reporting.

Adopted Notation: This is a master table with pre-configured data,
maintained for simplification of end-usage report generation. By
default, the tables are named like:

```
ams.dmw_<column-name>
```

Where, `dmw` stands for "derived master" records, and this is a new
suffix added into the project. In case, the original column names
starts with a leading (`_`, i.e.,, in case of derived columns) then
only single (`_`) sign.
