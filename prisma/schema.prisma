/********************************************************************
Prisma Schema File for Model ORM for Project Finfolio Application

The ``schema.prisma`` file is generated using node prisma initialize
command, and the environment variables are auto-populated. More
information about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema.

More information on speeding up queries using serverless/edge design
then use accelerate: https://pris.ly/cli/accelerate-init.

The schema files are seperated into multiple files based on the schema
design. For more information, check ``../database/schema/`` for code
documentation, or follow https://dbdocs.io/dpramanik.official/finfolio
for database documentation.

By database design, multiple schemas were used based on the type of
table and the needed security purposes.
